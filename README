This is version 0.3.0 of libdict.

Libdict is an ANSI C library which provides a set of efficient data
structures for storing key-data pairs. Libdict includes height-balanced
(AVL) trees, red-black trees, splay trees, weight-balanced trees,
path-reduction trees, treaps, and hashtables. In addition, these
data structures can be accessed through a generic interface, so that the
underlying data structure used can be changed without the need to modify
the calling code.

libdict is released under the BSD license; please refer to the file
LICENSE for more information.
